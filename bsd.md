BSD Sockets

> Unix Philosophy: Everything is a file

Opening sockets is different from opening a "real" file

Sockets read/write using the file interface

Process preemption can lead to migrating a thread to another processor

# Compatibility layer

Has a compatibility layer that allows it to run UNIX applications

If the application is using the UNIX syscalls, look them up in the compatibility table instead of BSD's

---

# Standardization

Extending - writing a replacement for a subsystem - requires reading the standard, not the code.
